# GreenNetworking
Project on Cloud Simulation

##################################################################################################################################

This is the project description that will enable you, as a cloud developer, to apply your Green
Networking knowledge into cloud and technically observe the intervals of how it can be turned
into benefit in a simulation environment. You will be introduced with a simulation tool called
CloudSim, that provides you to reserve resources in the cloud and observe the corresponding technical
parameters. CloudSim is a toolkit (library) for simulation of Cloud computing scenarios. It
provides basic classes for describing data centers, virtual machines, applications, users, computational
resources, and policies for management of diverse parts of the system (e.g., scheduling
and provisioning). The CloudSim simulation layer provides support for modeling and simulation
of virtualized cloud-based data center environments including dedicated management interfaces
for Virtual Machine (VM)’s, memory, storage, and bandwidth.
In addition, CloudSim can simulate Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) by extending the datacenter
entity that can manage number of host entities. Entity in CloudSim corresponds to an instance
of a component, where a component can be a class, or set of classes that represent one CloudSim
model, e.g., data center, host. Each host is assigned to one or more VMs. The VM allocation
is defined by the Cloud service provider. For more information on CloudSim, please visit [1].
What can you do with CloudSim?
• generate a mix of workload request distributions, application configurations
• model Cloud availability scenarios and perform robust tests based on the custom configurations
• implement custom application provisioning techniques for clouds and their federation
